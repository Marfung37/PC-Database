# PC-Database
SQL* (currently just tsv files) based database of all pc setups

# Scripts
Currently, there are 4 scripts written

* Setup Finder - setup_finder.py
* Average Percent - average_percent.py
* Cover Data - cover_data.py
* Check Percents - check_percents.py

The last 2 doesn't have the user input yet

# Future Plans
Hopefully, all checks in notes.txt will be added  
If you can think of more checks, please let me know!

Then, a method to adding setups to the database should be included
