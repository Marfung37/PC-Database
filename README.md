# PC-Database
SQL* (currently just tsv files) based database of all pc setups

# Scripts
Currently, there are 2 user scripts written and last 4 helping add data into database

* Setup Finder - setup_finder.py
* Average Percent - average_percent.py
* Cover Data - cover_data.py
* Check Percents - check_percents.py
* Fill Columns - fill_columns.py
* Assign Mirrors - assign_mirrors.py

# Future Plans
Then, a method to adding setups to the database should be included  
Currently, not sure how this will be handled in a user friendly way.
