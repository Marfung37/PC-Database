# PC-Database
SQL* (currently just tsv files) based database of all pc setups

# Scripts
Currently, there are 4 user scripts written

* Setup Finder - setup_finder.py
* Average Percent - average_percent.py
* Cover Data - cover_data.py
* Check Percents - check_percents.py

# Future Plans
Then, a method to adding setups to the database should be included  
Currently, not sure how this will be handled in a user friendly way.
